Welcome to the SmartAgro React Coding Challenge! This project is set up as a starter for you to build a functional Task Management Dashboard.

## 🚀 Getting Started

   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:

## 📋 Requirements

### Core Features
- **Task Creation**: Form with Title (req), Description, and Priority.
- **Management**: Display tasks in cards, allow status updates (To Do -> In Progress -> Done).
- **Filtering**: Search by text and filter by Status/Priority.
- **Statistics**: Live counts and a completion progress bar.

### Technical Constraints
- Use Functional Components and Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- Follow the provided component architecture in `src/components/`.
- Maintain the professional styling defined in `App.css`.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/App.js`: Main logic and state (Starter provided).
- `src/App.css`: Styles (Already complete - do not modify unless needed).

Good luck!
